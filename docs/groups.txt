This file is documentation for the Blockrooms groups, and other notable differences.
For one, unlike in Minetest Game, 0 is the weakest and the strength goes up with the value, meaning you can make stronger materials by using a higher number.

Anyway, here are the actual mining groups:
hand_breakable | whether or not something can be broken by the hand, the equivalent to "oddly_breakable_by_hand"
papery | not specifically for paper, but stuff that can be cut via sharp but not super strong objects, for instance, glass shards and scissors for the lower level, low tier axes for the higher ones
rubbly | used for rubble or rubble like stuff, typically requires a shovel to mine.
choppy | used for logs or other wood like objects, you likely need an axe.
cracky | used for stone or stone like stuff
blunt | used for nodes that need blunt force to be mined, this is used for most ceiling tiles.
soft | wool or what not. Not automatically breakable by hand, more effective with shears and shearlike objects
near_instant | breakable by hand, but its really fast. has an extra 9 mining level
teary | similar to hand_breakable but the hand is really, really slow. gloves are best for these sorts of materials.

Here are the item groups:
wood | for medium sized wood objects
stone | any medium sized stone object
rock | any small sized stone object
sticky | anything sticky, tape, glue, whatever
metal | any kind of metal
iron | stuff that contains or is out of iron
writable | if its 1, it can be used to write on paper repeatedly, if its 2, it will lock the paper on whatever the user writes on it next.



Mining Levels(each mining level can mine all the ones before it):
1 - Very basic "tools", typically random objects, spoons, forks, glass shards, whatever.
2 - Low tier makeshift tools, like a wooden board mixed with a glass shard
3 - Some actual rudemntry tools, poorly put together hammers, various objects taped together to form fake tools.
4 - Basic proper tools, wooden/stone tools for the most part
5 - Proper mechanical tools, real drills, wire cutters, proper pickaxes, so on.
6 - Advanced mechanical tools, more powerful drills, acids, etc
7 - Multiblock miners. Lasers, minining machines, etc.
8 - Anomalous artifacts/tool (if any end up existing)
